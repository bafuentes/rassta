 \
`rassta` (**r**aster-based **s**patial **st**ratification **a**lgorithms) is a collection of algorithms  
for the spatial stratification of landscapes, sampling, and modeling of spatially-varying  
phenomena in the [R](https://www.r-project.org) environment.

`rassta` offers a simple framework for the stratification of geographic space based on  
raster layers representing landscape factors and/or factor scales. The stratification  
process follows a hierarchical approach, which is based on first level units (i.e.,  
classification units) and second-level units (i.e., stratification units). Nonparametric  
techniques allow to measure the correspondence between the geographic space and  
the landscape configuration represented by the units. These correspondence metrics  
are useful to define sampling schemes and to model the spatial variability of environmental  
phenomena.

## Installation

`rassta` is available from CRAN, so the current **released version** can be
installed as follows:
```
install.packages("rassta")
```

To install the development version from github, please use:
```
remotes::install_github("bafuentes/rassta")
```

## Acknowledgments

`rassta` greatly benefits from past and current efforts to make spatial data
analysis fully operational in R, which in turn have benefited from titans like
GDAL, PROJ, GEOS, etc. Special thanks to the minds behind the `raster`, `rgdal`,
`rgeos`, and `sf` packages, and those behind the packages that `rassta` depends
on as well.

## Citation

A journal article describing the analysis and theoretical background of `rassta`
is on its way. In the meantime, if you use `rassta` as part of your research
please consider including the following citation in your work:
