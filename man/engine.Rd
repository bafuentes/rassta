\arguments{
\item{res.type}{Character. Type of response to model. Options are "cont" for
continuous, and "cat" for categorical response. Default: "cont"}

\item{ls.rast}{SpatRaster, as in \code{\link[terra]{rast}}. Multi-layer
SpatRaster representing landscape similarities to stratification units.
Only similarities for units with a representative observation are allowed.
Character prefix in the file name of similarities is allowed.}

\item{n.win}{Integer. Positive number indicating how many winning
stratification units should be considered. See \strong{Details}. Default: 3}

\item{su.repobs}{Data frame. The first column of this data frame must contain
only the numeric code for the stratification units (without prefix). Each
additional column must contain the value of the representative response
observation for each stratification unit. Multiple response variables are
allowed (one per column). Note that all response variables in the data
frame must share the same type (\emph{res.type}). See example on issues
related to \strong{non-explicit column names}.}

\item{tiles}{SpatVector, as in \code{\link[terra]{vect}}. Spatial vector of
polygon geometry with the boundaries of the area of interest. This vector
can be subdivided in regions (i.e., tiles) to balance memory allocation and
processing speed (see \strong{Details}). If this vector is tiled, then its
attribute table must only contain an ID column with a unique identifier for
each tile (1,2,...,n). Additionally, This vector must have the same
coordinate reference system as \emph{ls.rast}.}

\item{parallel}{Boolean. Perform parallel processing? A parallel backend
needs to be registered beforehand with
\code{\link[doParallel]{registerDoParallel}}. Moreover, a tiled spatial
vector should be supplied for \emph{tiles}. Default: FALSE}

\item{outdir}{Character. String specifying the path for the output raster
tiles/layer(s) of modeled response(s). Default: "."}

\item{tile.rm}{Boolean. Should the tiles of modeled response(s) be removed
from disk after the tile merging process? Default: TRUE}

\item{extension}{Character. String specifying the extension for the output
raster layer(s) of modeled response(s). Default: ".tif"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments as for \code{\link[terra]{writeRaster}}.}
}
\value{
Multi-layer or single-layer SpatRaster with modeled response(s).

\description{
Modeling of spatially varying phenomena based on landscape similarity to
stratification units. The rationale behind this modeling approach is that if
each stratification unit across geographic space represents a distinctive
configuration in terms of multiple landscape factors and/or factor scales
(e.g., topography, climate, micro-climate, etc.), and if each of these
configurations influences a phenomenon in a distinct way, then the spatial
variability of that phenomenon can be assessed across a landscape by relating
each geographic location to each distinctive configuration. Therefore, the
more similar a geographic location is to the landscape configuration
represented by a given stratification unit, then also the more similar the
response of a phenomenon will be at that location to the typical response for
conditions within the given stratification unit. Both continuous and
categorical response variables are supported. For categorical responses, each
category must be identified by an integer value.
}
\details{
The spatial modeling process is cell-wise, which means that it operates on a
cell-by-cell basis. For a given cell occurring in the geographic space
supported by a raster layer, the spatial modeling engine first identifies the
\emph{n} stratification units to which the given cell is most similar (i.e.,
'winning stratification units'). The engine is able to identify the winning
stratification units thanks to the user-provided set of landscape similarity
layers \emph{ls.rast}. Subsequently, the response value from the
representative observation for each winning stratification unit is
identified. In the case of a continuous response, a weighted average of
representative response values is performed. For each representative response
value, the weight is equal to the corresponding stratification unit's
landscape similarity value in the given cell. The result of the weighted
average is assigned as the response value in the given cell. In the case of a
categorical response, the modal value from the representative response values
of the \emph{n} winning stratification units is assigned to the given cell.

Note that the name for each raster layer in \emph{ls.rast} should match the
numeric code of the corresponding stratification unit, which is obtained from
the column of numeric codes in \emph{su.repobs}. Nevertheless, raster layer
names in \emph{ls.rast} with a character prefix in the numeric code and/or
file extension should work fine (e.g., "su_1101.tif" instead of "1101"). If
the landscape similarity layers in \emph{ls.rast} were created with
\code{\link{similarity}}, then raster layer names will not have any prefix
nor extension as part of the numeric code.

When dealing with large geographic spaces, high raster resolutions (i.e.,
small cell sizes), or both, a considerable amount of memory is required to
perform the modeling process. To reduce memory usage, the spatial modeling
engine performs tile-based processing of landscape similarity layers and
\strong{writes results directly on disk}. Tile-based processing increases the
computational time, thus parallelization is allowed by setting up a parallel
backend. If parallelization is enabled, then care must be taken with the size
of the tiles since larger sizes will have a greater impact on memory usage.
Consequently, the parallel, tile-based processing will be less useful.

# A note on non-explicit response's names (obtained from su.repobs):

## This will result in incorrectly modeled response values
x <- c("SOM", "SOM_30cm", "SOM_45cm")    # SOM = soil organic matter
grep(x[1], x)                            # Non explicit

grep(x[3], x)                            # Explicit

## This will will result in correct values
