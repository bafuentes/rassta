# rassta 1.0.3

* All the functions that return SpatRaster objects now assign proper variable names 
instead of getting the names from a reference SpatRaster.

* Fixed a bug which prevented ‘select_functions()’ from running properly when the 
argument ‘var.rast’ represents a single-layer SpatRaster object.

* ‘select_functions()’ now allows to work with SpatRaster objects representing 
classification units whose numeric IDs are not sequentially defined (e.g., unordered 
classification units).

* Fixed a bug which prevented ‘strata()’ from retrieving the correct minimum and 
maximum values from SpatRaster objects with NA values present, and thus, from 
assigning the correct numeric codes for stratification units.  


# rassta 1.0.2

* Some functions have been renamed and vignettes for some functions have been created.


# rassta 1.0.1
